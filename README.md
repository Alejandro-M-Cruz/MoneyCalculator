# MoneyCalculator
MoneyCalculator is an application that takes an initial amount of a selected currency and converts it to another currency.

It has some extra functionality, like a button that swaps the base and destination currencies and the possibility of introducing either a comma 
or a dot as decimal separator in the initial amount.
